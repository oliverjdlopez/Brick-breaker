This is a remake of brick-breaker, the classic and nostalgic game.

Notable features of the game include keyboard controls, configurable app state, collision detection, and real-time updates. Unfortunately, I can only post the built version and not the source because I used a library which is not yet public (written by my professor Abe Davis).

Please feel free to try it out! It's hosted at https://oliverjdlopez.github.io/Brick-breaker/build/index.html
